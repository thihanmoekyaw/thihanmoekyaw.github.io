Technical Progress I’ve made the Raymond javascript and node.js version to have the GPT prompts saved automatically. I’ve ported and made the Raymond project backend into a flask app as well. I really prefer this approach as flask is a lot more lightweight compared to using node.js. Additionally, I use python the most day-to-day as well. An additional feature that I’ve added is to save the chat history into .json file. In theory, this should also help to build a no-sql database in the future as well. Since the project is not that complicated yet, this is just for the purpose of storing the chat history. Here are some explanations of the chat_history.json file: prompt: The prompt engineered by the Raymond Project Engineers user_message: The prompt that user has typed (i.e: user’s message) bot_response: Shinzen A1 output model: The type of gpt model used (example: ChatGPT api is gpt-3.5-turbo) In the current stage, Shinzen A1 do not have any memory to prior messages by itself or by the user. The way the model works right now is such that the input is the prompt + user_message for the model to output each response. One question: should I add a unique_identifier? If we want to scale up to have more users, we need to add a login like in ChatGPT. This will depend on the direction of how the project go. Prompting This is the example API call and the warning given in the OpenAI documentation as of now: # Note: you need to be using OpenAI Python v0.27.0 for the code below to work import openai openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=[ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"} ] ) Info gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not always pay strong attention to system messages. Future models will be trained to pay stronger attention to system messages. In the current phase, the GPT-3.5-turbo model is set default to the gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 if you call the API so I prompted in a way to not use the system command much. Here is the latest prompt that I am using: Role Content system You are a helpful AI meditation guide trained under Shinzen Young’s Unified Mindfulness system.

Primarily, the direction that I went into this project is about improving data visualization in GWAS and EWAS study, especially in how to make the manhattan plot to be more interactive and easy for the research scientist to use. The aim of the project is to use the state-of-the-art packages available in open-source community and adding features in the source code. A traditional researcher in biology focus on the research and analysis and need to train themselves in coding to use state-of-the-art tools or get help from more knowledgeable research engineers. For this project, we aim to develop data visualizations based in google colab for dashboards. Why Google Colab? The packages we used are python based and we wanted a tool that we can share the researchers easy to use everywhere without the need to computational resources, while being very easy for minimal for the researchers to use. Because google colab offer free compute for everyone (at least at the time of writing), we decided to develop our dashboard to optimize with google colab.

There is a bug in the annotations of the NCSA_ManhattanPlot function and fixed it (took a while but FINALLYYYYY) Added radio buttons for the user to use either used the Benjamini_Hochberg_val function or to use the slider for the red line in the vizualization. Added a dropdown menu where user can select the gene pathway they want to display. The user can select multiple. For now, as a demonstration purpose, I changed the code so that the datafiles do not need authentication when runned on colab. Next Steps I will be preparing for the NCSA conference. After the conference, I will add more features such as ability to insert user’s own gwas data. With Fatma’s feedback (researcher for the GWAS study for the Strong Kids 2 study), I will make the visualization display orange dots even above the threshold line (the red line in the plot) if it is in the gene pathway.

The new feature allows the visualization of a specific gene pathway by highlighting the corresponding data points with a distinct color (green). Changes Made Modified the NCSA_ManhattanPlot function and the _ManhattanPlot class to accept an optional “IN_PATHWAY” parameter, which is a boolean column indicating whether a data point is part of the gene pathway of interest. NCSA_ManhattanPlot is the modified version of the ManhattanPlot source code from dash_bio python library. Updated the figure generation code to adjust the color of the data points based on the “IN_PATHWAY” column values. Provided a method to process the existing “UCSC_REFGENE_GROUP” column in the input pandas dataframe, creating a new “IN_PATHWAY” column that can be used with the modified NCSA_ManhattanPlot function. Usage To use the updated Manhattan Plot with gene pathway highlighting: Process the input dataframe to create a new “IN_PATHWAY” boolean column based on the “UCSC_REFGENE_GROUP” column and the pathway keyword of interest (e.g., “Body”). pathway_keyword = \"Body\" df[\"IN_PATHWAY\"] = df[\"UCSC_REFGENE_GROUP\"].apply(lambda x: pathway_keyword in str(x)) Pass the modified dataframe with the “IN_PATHWAY” column to the NCSA_ManhattanPlot function. fig = NCSA_ManhattanPlot(df, in_pathway=\"IN_PATHWAY\") This will generate a Manhattan Plot with data points in the specified gene pathway highlighted in green. Next Steps The team can now use the updated Manhattan Plot implementation to visualize specific gene pathways in their data. If needed, further customization or additional features can be added to the existing code.

The first thing I did was to implement the notebook in the NCSA server with a JupyterLab Docker container. I extracted the necessary data and reduced the data to the bare minimum requirements to plot it using the dash_bio package. Side note: I also made a pull request to improve the documentation (it was very incomplete at the time of writing this). After making things reliable, I ported the notebook to work in Google Colab. Our notebook is meant for researchers with some Python experience to use state-of-the-art tools in GWAS studies, making it reliable in Google Colab. Currently, these are the main things I have implemented so far for the Manhattan plot: Bonferroni Correction: a method of adjusting the p-value threshold for statistical significance when conducting multiple hypothesis tests Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure: a multiple testing correction method used to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in statistical hypothesis testing. After porting, I did a lot of testing to predict how long the graphing function is going to take. Here are some steps I’ve taken: Gathered data on the runtime of the Manhattan plot to display (I put it in a dictionary). I graphed the runtime relative to the number of rows in the data. I found out that the graph function runs in linear time. I performed linear regressions to predict how long it takes to make the plot in 25 seconds.
