I excrected the necessary data and reduce the data to the bare minimum requirement to plot it using dash_bio package. Side note: I also did a pull request to improve the documentation (it was very incomplete at the time I am writing right now) After things became reliable, I port it make the notebook to work in Google Colab. Our notebook is meant for researchers with a few python experience to be able to use the state-of-the-art tools in GWAS studies (and thus, making it reliable in Google Colab). Currently, these are the main things I have implemented so far for the mahanttan plot: Bonferroni Correction: a method of adjusting the p-value threshold for statistical significance when conducting multiple hypothesis tests Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure: a multiple testing correction method used to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in statistical hypothesis testing. After porting, I did a lot of testing to predict how long the graphing function is going to take. Here are some steps I’ve taken: Gathered data of the runtime of the mahantann plot to display (I put it in a dict) I graph the runtime relative to the number of rows in the data. I found out that the graph function run in a linear time. I performed linear regressions to predict how long it takes in order to be able to make the plot in 25 seconds ","date":"02-27-2023","objectID":"/ncsa-visual-analytics-bookmarks/:4:1","tags":["NCSA","GWAS"],"title":"NCSA Visual Analytics, Thihan","uri":"/ncsa-visual-analytics-bookmarks/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Some notes ","date":"02-27-2023","objectID":"/ncsa-visual-analytics-bookmarks/:5:0","tags":["NCSA","GWAS"],"title":"NCSA Visual Analytics, Thihan","uri":"/ncsa-visual-analytics-bookmarks/"},{"categories":null,"content":"March 1st, 2023 It is more preferable to make jupyter notebook into a runnable dashboard.
