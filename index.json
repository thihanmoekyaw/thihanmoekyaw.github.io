[{"categories":null,"content":"Hello I am Thihan! I like to learn and implement cutting edge researches into real-world use. I am an industrial engineer by trait, and I go on solving a lot of my tasks with a multidisciplinary approach in mind. Currently, my focus is in Artificial Intelligence and trying to can we go about creating simulations for generalized tasks, with safety as the top priority. I am open to help Artificial Intelligence projects/organization with my knowledge. My goal is to keep the current state of the AGI research in a safe manner so the works in AI research leads to a nash equilibrium rather than a zero-sum game (i.e. not nuclear war equivalent scenario in geopolitics of AI research).

I work with researchers and industry partners to implement and deploy AI and ML researches into practical settings. I also provide software architectures and trainings for the use of high performance computing systems. I also advice non-profits and startups in the field of AGI as part of my interest towards safe development of AGI researches and progresses. Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the NCSA with the Healthcare Innovation System Office. I was responsible for making biostatistics models and data visualizations for genomics studies. Alongside to it, I served as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at Gies College of Business. In the past, I’ve also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS 547: Deep Learning and IE 532: Integer Programming courses at Grainger College of Engineering. In my undergrad as well, I was a Teaching Assistant for the CS and the math departments. Also, I was an undergrad research assistant at the HiMER Lab to study the use of voice assistants and their limitations.

My formal concentration for the program was in advanced analytics and operations research. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the program, my coursework was heavy on AI and ML on the engineering side, along with few courses from the Finance and Economic department. Before that, I pursued my Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). I focused more on process management and operations research for my undergrad.

I collaborated with Industrial Engineering students to create a machine learning model to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events. In UIC, I worked with Fermilab (along with ME and IE students) to build a proof-of-concept robot for the maintenance of the NuMI system using deep learning for machine vision.
