# Self Study Bookmarks


## Why is this here?

Because I kinda use multiple computers, this in theory keep my housingkeeping simpler. One other thing is people can probably learn the contents that I use for learning as well! Or this will be scraped for use of machine learning, which I don't really mind too much as well... If you are not Thihan (the author) and viewing this, hello!

Depending on how my workflow goes, I may or may not be updating this site. You can see the last update below.
