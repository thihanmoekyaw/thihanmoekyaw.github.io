# NCSA Visual Analytics, Thihan's Bookmarks

## Intro

This page contains the contents of the progresses GWAS & EWAS researchs in collaboration with the NCSA [Healthcare Innovation Program Office](https://ncsamainsite.web.illinois.edu/research/health-sciences/healthcare-innovation-program-office/) and the [STRONG KIDS 2](https://www.familyresiliency.illinois.edu/strong-kids-2-cells-society-approach-nutrition) study (specifically the part that I am involved in). I will be using this website to track my progresses. That being said, the files shared within UIUC and NCSA will be shared internally only and will only be shared publicly when all affiliated members agree to make it public.

## Some notes

### March 1st, 2023

- It is more preferable to make jupyter notebook into a runnable dashboard. Chromosome is AI, start value is AJ (position on the chromosome), significant at the snip (colunmn I, this is -log_10 p vlaue)

- Our plan is to change things to plotly first, and then use jupyterDash to make it interactive if needed.

### Feb 28th, 2023

- Plotly released a version of dashboarding library in jupyter notebook called [JupyterDash](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-jupyterdash-811f1f57c02e)
  - One thing about plotly dash is that it is also available for dashboarding on R and Julia (bioinformatics not available)
