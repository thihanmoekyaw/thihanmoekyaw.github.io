# NCSA Visual Analytics Bookmarks

## Intro

This page contains the contents of the GWAS & EWAS studies doing in collaboration with the NCSA [Healthcare Innovation Program Office](https://ncsamainsite.web.illinois.edu/research/health-sciences/healthcare-innovation-program-office/) and the [STRONG KIDS 2](https://www.familyresiliency.illinois.edu/strong-kids-2-cells-society-approach-nutrition) study (specifically the part that I am involved in). I will be using this website to track my progresses. That being said, the files shared within UIUC and NCSA will be shared internally only and will only be shared publicly when all affiliated members agree to make it public.
