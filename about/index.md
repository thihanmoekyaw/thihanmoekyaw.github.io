# About Me!


## Hello

I am Thihan Moe Kyaw!

I like to learn and implement cutting edge researches into real-world use. I am an industrial engineer by trait, and I go on solving a lot of my tasks with a multidisciplinary approach in mind.

Currently, my focus is in Artificial Intelligence and trying to can we go about creating simulations for generalized tasks, with safety as the top priority. I am open to help Artificial Intelligence projects/organization with my knowledge. My goal is to keep the current state of the AGI research in a safe manner so the works in AI research leads to a nash equilibrium rather than a zero-sum game (i.e. not nuclear war equivalent scenario in geopolitics of AI research).

## Education

Formal education wise, I pursued M.S in Industrial Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu)). My formal concentration for the program was in advanced analytics and operations research. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the program, my coursework was heavy on AI and ML on the engineering side, along with few courses from the Finance and Economic department.

Before that, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I focused more on process management and operations research for my undergrad.

## Work Experience

** Note: due to confidentiality matters, this section may not be updated!**

I used to worked as a [Graduate Research Assistant at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/). I was responsible for making biostatistics models and data visualizations for genomics studies. Alongside to it, I served as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at [Gies College of Business](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/).

In the past, I've also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CS 547: Deep Learning](https://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/ie534-cs-547-fall-2022/) and [IE 532: Integer Programming](https://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/courses/ie511) courses at [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/). In my undergrad as well, I was a Teaching Assistant for the CS and the math departments.

Also, I was an undergrad research assistant at the [HiMER Lab](https://himer.lab.asu.edu/)!

## Projects

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with Industrial Engineering students to create a machine learning model to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events.

In UIC, I worked with Fermilab (along with ME and IE students) to build a proof-of-concept robot for the maintenance of the [NuMI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI) using deep learning for machine vision.

More projects to be updated soon!
