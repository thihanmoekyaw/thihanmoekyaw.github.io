# About Me!


## Hello

I am Thihan Moe Kyaw!

I just graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for my master degree in Industrial Engineering. I do a lot of stuffs with cutting edge researches and I love helping non-profits. Currently, my focus is in Artificial General Intelligence and seeing how can we go about creating such systems.

I am an engineer by trait, and I go on solving a lot of my tasks with a multidisciplinary approach in mind.

## Education

My last time in school was in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu)) for my Master of Science in Industrial Engineering. Pretty cool place I would say. Since it is a public university and have a very well connected engineering school, I was exposed to some cutting edge stuffs in compting and met a lot of life long friends.

Before that, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I focused more on process management and operations research back then. I was fairly young and was on a tight budget so I tried a lot of different things and helped a bunch of researches.

For various reasons, I now focus on AI, and it is complicated. My formal concentration is advanced analytics and operations research for my master program.

## Work Experience

Currently, I am working with non-profits on some AI projects. My main focus right now is to make sure we as humanity can create AGIs models that focuses on safety.

I am currently helping some organizations but due to the respect for their privacy, I will update about these details later.

I used to worked as a [Graduate Research Assistant at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/). I was responsible for making biostatistics models and data visualizations for genomics studies. Alongside to it, I served as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at Gies College of Business.

In the past, I've also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CS 547: Deep Learning](https://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/ie534-cs-547-fall-2022/) and [IE 532: Integer Programming](https://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/courses/ie511) courses at Grainger College of Engineering. In my undergrad as well, I was a TA for the CS and the math department.

Also, I was an undergrad research assistant at the [HiMER Lab](https://himer.lab.asu.edu/)!

## Some more experiences that I can share

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with Industrial Engineering students to create a machine learning model to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events.

In UIC, I worked with Fermilab (along with ME and IE students) to build a proof-of-concept robot for the maintenance of the [NuMI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI) using deep learning for machine vision.

In my free time, I like to host Japanese tea ceremonies! I was trained [at the Japan House of UofI](https://urasenkeurbana.weebly.com/). If you ever want a fresh bowl of tea, I am happy to serve you!
