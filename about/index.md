# About Me!


## Hello

I am Thihan!

I like to learn and implement cutting edge researches into real-world use. I am an industrial engineer by trait, and I go on solving a lot of my tasks with a multidisciplinary approach in mind.

Currently, my focus is with Artificial Intelligence and trying to see how can we go about creating simulations for generalized tasks, with safety as the top priority. I am open to help Artificial Intelligence projects/organization with my knowledge. 

My goal is to keep the current state of the AGI research in a safe manner so the works in AI research leads to a nash equilibrium rather than a zero-sum game (i.e. not nuclear war equivalent scenario in geopolitics of AI research).

## Experiences

I am a Research Software Engineer at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), as part of the [Data Analytics team](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/expertise/data-analytics/). I work with researchers and industry partners to implement and deploy AI and ML researches into practical settings. I also provide software architectures and trainings for the use of high performance computing systems.

In my free times, advice non-profits and startups related to AGI research as part of my interest towards safe development of AGI researches and progresses.

Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the NCSA with the [Healthcare Innovation System Office](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/health-sciences/healthcare-innovation-program-office/). I was responsible for making biostatistics models and data visualizations for genomics studies. Alongside to it, I served as the Lead Graduate Teaching Assistant (BDI 513: Data Storytelling) at the [Gies College of Business](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/).

I've also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CS 547: Deep Learning](https://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/ie534-cs-547-fall-2022/) and [IE 532: Integer Programming](https://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/courses/ie511) courses at [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/). In my undergrad as well, I was a Teaching Assistant for the CS and the math departments.

Also, I was an undergrad research assistant at the [HiMER Lab](https://himer.lab.asu.edu/) to study the use of voice assistants and their limitations.

## Education

Formal education wise, I pursued M.S in Industrial Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu)). My formal concentration for the program was in advanced analytics and operations research. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the program, my coursework was heavy on AI and ML on the engineering side, along with few courses from the Finance and Economic department.

Before that, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://www.uic.edu/)). I focused more on process management and operations research for my undergrad.

## Projects

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a project for Terrorist Network Detection. I collaborated with Industrial Engineering students to create a machine learning model to classify and analyze potential networks between terrorist organizations using over 18,000 terrorist events.

In UIC, I worked with Fermilab (along with ME and IE students) to build a proof-of-concept robot for the maintenance of the [NuMI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuMI) using deep learning for machine vision.

More projects to be updated soon! Based on the NDAs...

## Interests

A huge part of my life has been to help others not just with my background, but also through anyway possible. What is life without helping other really?

I really enjoy meditating in my free time. I grew up in Myanmar (Burma) where the culture of vipassana meditation is prevalence across the country. It is a cultural heritage that I want to share more of. I still seek out to learn all the various meditation/spiritual traditions across different cultures. Afterall, we want to have a [beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) in this journey.

I am also certified under the [Urasenke tea ceremony school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urasenke) to host a few variants of [Japanese Tea Ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony). I am happy to host one for you anytime (just ask)!
